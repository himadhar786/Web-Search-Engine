Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. Connecting to GitHub with SSH You can connect to GitHub using the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), which provides a secure channel over an unsecured network. Creating and managing repositories You can create a repository on GitHub to store and collaborate on your project's files, then manage the repository's name and location. Basic writing and formatting syntax Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax. Popular About pull requests Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. Authentication documentation Keep your account and data secure with features like two-factor authentication, SSH, and commit signature verification. Adding locally hosted code to GitHub If your code is stored locally on your computer and is tracked by Git or not tracked by any version control system (VCS), you can import the code to GitHub using GitHub CLI or Git commands.
